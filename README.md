I modified http://ghost.tweakblogs.net/blog/3073/subversion-repository-monitor.html to show
commit messages and changed how often it runs

I am not the original author of this, I have just made a couple of tiny tweaks and committed it
to Github for safety's sake.

Change list:

1. Show commit messages
2. Run more often (modify this yourself for your needs)
